# Digits-Classification-
Digits classification from the MNIST dataset
We used 3 types of Feature Extraction:
1 - SIFT
2 - Pixel-based approach ( Flatten )
3 - HOG
In flatten approach and HOG there are a large number of features so we used a genetic algorithm to select the best features and used in fit function f-score to determine the effect of each feature on the output.
